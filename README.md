Features of PHP-8.4

### Block Arrow Functions
PHP introduced arrow functions in 7.4, but they were limited to single expressions. PHP 8.4 extends this with Block Arrow Functions, which allow multi-line statements in arrow function syntax. This means you can now write complex logic without needing a traditional closure.

### Example:
```
$calculateTotal = fn($price, $tax) => {
    $total = $price + ($price * $tax);
    if ($total > 100) {
        return $total - 10; // Apply discount
    }
    return $total;
};

echo $calculateTotal(120, 0.15); // Outputs: 124
```

### JSON Exception Handling
JSON errors in PHP have historically been handled by json_last_error(), a function that is easy to overlook and requires additional code. PHP 8.4 enhances JSON error handling by introducing exceptions that trigger automatically on error, making JSON error management easier and more reliable.

#Example:
```
try {
    $data = json_decode('{"key":value}', true, 512, JSON_THROW_ON_ERROR);
} catch (JsonException $e) {
    echo "JSON Error: " . $e->getMessage();
}
```

This simplifies error management in JSON encoding and decoding, helping avoid silent JSON parsing failures.

### Typed Properties in Traits
With PHP 8.4, you can now use typed properties within traits, something previously unsupported. Typed properties ensure data consistency across classes that use traits, particularly helpful in larger projects where strict typing is essential.

### Example:
```
trait ProductTrait {
    public string $productName;
}

class Inventory {
    use ProductTrait;
}

$inventory = new Inventory();
$inventory->productName = 'Widget'; // Works fine
$inventory->productName = 123;      // Throws a TypeError in PHP 8.4
```
This enhancement brings the advantages of typed properties to traits, making traits more versatile and type-safe.

 
### Lazy Class Loading
PHP 8.4 introduces Lazy Class Loading, allowing classes to be loaded only when they are first used. Lazy loading can reduce memory usage and speed up initial load times, particularly beneficial in large applications with many dependencies.

Example:
// No direct example, but in frameworks and large apps, this optimization
// allows unused classes to remain unloaded until needed.
Makefile
This is particularly useful in dependency-heavy environments, allowing PHP applications to load only necessary classes at runtime.

### DatePeriod Enhancements
Working with dates becomes easier with PHP 8.4's DatePeriod enhancements. It now supports more granular interval adjustments and better date range handling, which is particularly useful in data-driven applications that work with time periods.

Example:
```
$start = new DateTime('2023-01-01');
$end = new DateTime('2023-01-10');
$interval = new DateInterval('P2D');
$datePeriod = new DatePeriod($start, $interval, $end);

foreach ($datePeriod as $date) {
    echo $date->format("Y-m-d") . "\n";
}
```
This update improves the functionality of DatePeriod, making it easier to handle date-based data.

### Enum Default Values
PHP 8.4 adds support for default values in enums, providing more control and flexibility when working with predefined options. This feature is particularly useful when enums represent static, unchanging values, such as statuses or types.

### Example:
```
enum Status: string {
    case DRAFT = 'draft';
    case PUBLISHED = 'published';
    case ARCHIVED = 'archived';
}

$status = Status::DRAFT;
echo $status->value; // Outputs: 'draft'
```
Enums with default values simplify state management, making code cleaner and more intuitive.

### Array Unpacking with String Keys
PHP 8.4 now supports array unpacking with associative arrays using string keys, a highly requested feature. This enhancement allows arrays with string keys to be merged with a simpler, more readable syntax.

### Example:
```
$array1 = ['name' => 'John', 'age' => 30];
$array2 = ['location' => 'USA', 'age' => 32]; // Overwrite age
$mergedArray = [...$array1, ...$array2];

// Result: ['name' => 'John', 'age' => 32, 'location' => 'USA']
```
This addition simplifies the array merge syntax, reducing the need for cumbersome array functions.

### Improved Named Arguments
PHP introduced named arguments in version 8.0, but it had limitations when working with certain dynamic scenarios. PHP 8.4 refines named arguments to support even more flexible naming conventions, improving code readability in complex functions with multiple parameters.

### Example:
```
function createUser($username, $email, $role = 'user') {
    // User creation logic
}

createUser(username: 'jdoe', email: 'jdoe@example.com', role: 'admin');
```
The refinements in PHP 8.4 allow for clearer, more manageable function calls.

### Extended JIT Compiler Optimizations
The Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler introduced in PHP 8.0 has been further optimized in PHP 8.4, bringing increased performance, especially in CPU-intensive applications. With these enhancements, developers can expect faster execution times for complex operations, particularly beneficial in machine learning, data processing, and real-time applications.

### Example:
// While no direct syntax change exists, the improvements here benefit
// all PHP scripts through enhanced runtime efficiency.
Makefile
These JIT optimizations make PHP 8.4 a solid choice for CPU-bound tasks and large-scale applications.

### Enhanced Error Messages and Debugging
In PHP 8.4, error messages are now more descriptive, providing better context when exceptions occur. This improvement aims to make debugging faster and reduce the amount of time spent identifying issues.

### Example:
```
function divide($a, $b) {
    if ($b === 0) {
        throw new DivisionByZeroError("Cannot divide by zero.");
    }
    return $a / $b;
}

try {
    divide(10, 0);
} catch (DivisionByZeroError $e) {
    echo $e->getMessage(); // "Cannot divide by zero."
}
```
This provides a smoother debugging experience, especially in large applications where clear error messages are essential.

### New Array Utility Functions
PHP 8.4 adds several array utility functions that simplify common operations:

```
array_find(): This function helps locate the first item in an array that matches a given condition, making it easier to search within arrays. 
$result = array_find($array, fn($item) => $item > 10);
array_all(): This checks if all elements in an array meet a specified condition, improving readability and reducing the need for custom loops.
$allPositive = array_all($array, fn($num) => $num > 0);
```

These functions help reduce boilerplate code, making array manipulation cleaner and more concise.

### String Manipulation Enhancements
Handling multibyte characters in PHP can be challenging, especially when working with non-Latin alphabets. PHP 8.4 introduces two new functions for multibyte string case conversion:

```
mb_ucfirst(): Converts the first character of a multibyte string to uppercase.
$string = mb_ucfirst("example");
mb_lcfirst(): Converts the first character of a multibyte string to lowercase 
$string = mb_lcfirst("Example");
```
These additions streamline character case manipulation, particularly for applications needing multilingual support.

### Enhanced HTTP/3 Support in cURL
PHP 8.4 expands support for HTTP/3 in the cURL extension, improving the performance and efficiency of applications that make heavy use of networking. HTTP/3, with its underlying QUIC protocol, is faster and more reliable for data transfer. This enhancement is valuable for applications requiring high-speed data requests, like APIs and real-time services.

### Syntax Refinements: exit and die as Functions
In PHP 8.4, exit and die are redefined as true functions. This update removes inconsistencies in syntax, making exit and die behave like other standard functions. This change simplifies debugging and makes code formatting easier when using these exit points.

### Property Hooks
In PHP 8.4, Property hooks are inspired by languages like Kotlin, C#, and Swift, and the syntax includes two syntax variants that resemble short and multi-line closures:

```
<?php 
class User implements Named
{
    private bool $isModified = false;
 
    public function __construct(
        private string $first,
        private string $last
    ) {}
 
    public string $fullName {
        // Override the "read" action with arbitrary logic.
        get => $this->first . " " . $this->last;
 
        // Override the "write" action with arbitrary logic.
        set {
            [$this->first, $this->last] = explode(' ', $value, 2);
            $this->isModified = true;
        }
    }
}
```
The syntax doesn't require that both hooks always be defined together; in fact, here's an example of only defining set from the RFC:

```
class User
{
    public string $name {
        set {
            if (strlen($value) === 0) {
                throw new ValueError("Name must be non-empty");
            }
            $this->name = $value;
        }
    }
 
    public function __construct(string $name) {
        $this->name = $name;
    }
```
